# 👋 Hey, Jakub here!

🎯 I am passionate about analysis and data visualization. I would like to combine the pleasant with the useful by exploring real data with the use of modern tools - the application of machine learning, as well as the use of generative AI.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree from the SGH Warsaw School of Economics in *Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems*, which allowed me to acquire skills in statistics and econometric modeling, useful in solving real-world problems.

🌍 Location: Warsaw, Poland  
💼 Currently: seeking job opportunities
